    <p>
      I was born in New York and at the age of 2 retired to Florida, where I spent my formative years. I attended the University of Florida where I studied theater and French. After college I packed up and headed north to Chicago. Since moving here I've performed improv and sketch comedy, and appeared on more podcasts than any one person should.

      After spending most of my professional career in office administration I decided to make a shift towards something more fulfilling, and that started my journey with coding.
