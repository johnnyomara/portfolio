  <div class=about>
    <p>
      I was born in New York and at the age of 2 retired to Florida, where I spent my formative years. I attended the University of Florida where I studied theater and French. After college I packed up and headed north to Chicago. Since moving here I've performed improv and sketch comedy, and appeared on more podcasts than any one person should.

      <br>
      After spending most of my professional career in office administration I decided to make a shift towards something more fulfilling, and that started my journey with coding. I spent six months using free resources online to develop my skills, and to make sure I truly enjoyed doing it. As it turns out, I did! Once I was sure web development was the path for me I enrolled in Fullstack Academy's coding bootcamp.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since graduating I've been working as a senior teaching fellow, helping the next generation of web developers learn the skills they'll need to succeed!
